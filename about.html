               <b>WELCOME HOME FELLOW TRAVELER!</b> 
               <caption> <b>About</b> </caption>
                Hi, I’m Aman, a India Times best-selling author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day 
                and founder of this website! Have you ever thought to your self one of the following:
                
                “How do I find the money to travel? It seems too expensive for me.”
                “Where do I find the best travel deals?”
                “How do I save money on flights, accommodation, and other big expenses?”
                “How do I plan my trip?”
                “How do I stay safe and healthy?”
                “How do I maximize my time?”
                “I want to travel more but I don’t know the first step.”
                
                You are not alone. Over the past several years, I’ve helped millions of people
                 answer those questions and travel more with tested and proven tips and advice.
                  This way, you can spend less time searching the Internet and being overwhelmed 
                  with information and more time doing the one thing you want to do: travel more.
