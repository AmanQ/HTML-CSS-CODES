    <p><b>GREENLAND</b>
            Greenland is a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans.
             Much of its land surface is covered in ice. Most of its small population lives along the ice-free, 
             fjord-lined coast, particularly in the southwest. Its northerly position, largely above the Arctic Circle,
             results in natural phenomena such as summer’s midnight sun and winter’s Northern Lights.
