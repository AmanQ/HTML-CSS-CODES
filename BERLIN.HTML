             <b>BERLIN</b>
            Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century
            history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War,
            its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its
            art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.
