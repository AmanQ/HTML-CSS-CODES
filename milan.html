    <p><b>MILAN</b>
        Milan, a metropolis in Italy's northern Lombardy region, is a global capital of fashion and design.
        Home to the national stock exchange, it’s a financial hub also known for its high-end restaurants and shops.
        The Gothic Duomo di Milano cathedral and the Santa Maria delle Grazie convent, housing Leonardo da Vinci’s 
        mural “The Last Supper,” testify to centuries of art and culture.
